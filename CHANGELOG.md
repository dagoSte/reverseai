# Changelog

## Released milestones

Dates below are the release tags' creator dates: tagger date for annotated tags,
commit date for lightweight tags. Scope follows the repository's
[roadmap](README.md#roadmap); release candidates are not listed as releases.

| Date | Tag | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-11-01 | `v0.8.0` | Version 0.8.0: reconstruction exports and the AI analyst team. A Ghidra analysis is prepared once per file and kept in a private cache (`reverseai prepare`, MCP `prepare_file`); whole programs and single functions are exported in pages (functions, calls, references, strings, complete pseudocode and assembly), and MCP answers are compact by default with non-ASCII characters escaped in their text. The optional hive (`python3 -m hive run` from a checkout) rebuilds native programs as C or C++: a queen in code, parallel builder bees each with its own MCP server and a fenced folder, an independent council of three non-authors per module, a deterministic evidence checker, a confined compiler, conformance runs only when allowed, a pre-flight for packed programs and optional Codex bees refused while their sandbox reaches the network. Measured: wordtally (16/16 claims, 43/43 and 92/92 cases) and lz4 1.10.0 (282 functions, 448/448 claims, 68/68 and 127/127 independent cases, with the caveat in the README). The whole suite (2,200 tests) and the same wheel pass on macOS ARM64 (Python 3.15) and in a Linux ARM64 container (Python 3.12); the R1 native verifier (67/67) and the Ghidra containment proof (32/32) pass on the new r7 image. |
| 2026-10-24 | `v0.7.0` | Version 0.7.0: an MCP server (`reverseai mcp`, protocol revision 2026-07-28 with older clients supported) that gives AI agents the same verified questions over stdio, confined to an approved folder, with contained tools enabled only by the operator and file text marked untrusted; use cases with runnable examples, an infrastructure diagram, START.md, a coding-agent setup prompt and verified install paths (pip, uv, wheel, editable). Tested on real local files (Mach-O, PE, APK, npm tarball, Electron archive) and proven on macOS ARM64 (Python 3.15) and in a Linux ARM64 container (Python 3.12). |
| 2026-10-24 | `v0.6.2` | Version 0.6.2: a presentation README with a new logo and banner, a plain-language explanation of the tools and the locked container profile, and a usage guide; code comments, CLI help and report text free of internal development references. Analysis behaviour is unchanged; the whole suite, the installed wheel and the five native containment proofs pass on macOS ARM64 (Python 3.15) and in a Linux ARM64 container (Python 3.12). |
| 2026-10-24 | `m6b` | Version 0.6.1: MIT license with Metadata-Version 2.4 and preserved license files, offline editable install, an owner-started manual host-proof workflow for Linux and Windows x86-64 with SHA-pinned actions, experimental Windows report output bound to a directory handle, and offline LIEF and YARA-X builders; the whole suite and the same installed wheel proven on macOS ARM64 (Python 3.15) and in a Linux ARM64 container (Python 3.12). Windows and Linux x86-64 receipts await an owner-started run; an offline Ghidra build and AMD64 images remain deferred. |
| 2026-10-22 | `m6` | Version 0.6.0: Python packaging with a dependency-free in-tree build backend, reproducible wheel and sdist, offline installation, `reverseai --version` and a read-only `doctor`; the whole suite and the installed wheel proven on macOS ARM64 (Python 3.15) and in a Linux ARM64 container (Python 3.12). |
| 2026-10-22 | `m5c` | npm tarballs: bounded gzip/tar reading, file and header provenance, and existing JavaScript queries without extraction or installation. |
| 2026-10-22 | `m5b` | JavaScript syntax through a pinned parser in a locked container; module sources and sensitive calls remain derived, with verified byte anchors. |
| 2026-10-22 | `m5a` | Host-verified JavaScript file inventory, package.json declarations and lexical hints without sample execution. |
| 2026-10-22 | `m4b` | Contained JADX decompilation to derived Java, bound to host-verified DEX methods. |
| 2026-10-21 | `m4a` | APK inventory, binary manifest and DEX classes, methods and references, with compressed-member evidence under contract/3. |
| 2026-10-21 | `m3d` | Targeted native queries by name, address or text with paging. |
| 2026-10-21 | `m3c` | Ghidra assembly, references from code and referenced strings reported as derived evidence. |
| 2026-10-20 | `m3b` | Mach-O host decoding, verified imports for ELF/PE/Mach-O and Ghidra analysis of Mach-O. |
| 2026-10-20 | `m3a` | Contained Ghidra analysis of ELF/PE functions, pseudocode and calls as derived evidence under contract/2. |
| 2026-10-20 | `m2b` | Contained YARA-X with a reviewed literal ruleset and host-verified signature matches. |
| 2026-10-20 | `m2a` | Contained LIEF with host re-derivation of every reported header and section value. |
| 2026-10-20 | `m1` | Gateway, structural and capability analysts, evidence reviewer, and JSON/Markdown reports. |
